Immediate next steps:
1. Replace nat with bit_int in CrTransformer.
2. Define SmtSemantics using the same bit_ints.
3. Prove equivalence between CrTransformer and SmtSemantics versions of bit_ints.

Planned to dos:
1. Generalizing from single-packet semantics to stream semantics.
2. Unifying parsing and header processing into a single format.


Wishlist:
1. Prove that if a program has been checked for uninitialized variables, you don't have any instance of a None being returned from the lookup to the valuation map.
2. Semantics for the scheduler.
3. Looking at Xavier Leroy's summer school on compilers to see if there are any design patterns I am missing.
