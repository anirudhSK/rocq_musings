(* The axioms below can be put within a section.
   Context T : Type.
   Context eqb : T -> T -> bool. 
   Context my_eqb_reflexive : ...
   Context my_eqb_symmetric: ... *)
   (* Sections are more lightweight than modules, no namespace, no imports, etc. *)
   (* You can declare notations local to a section, but otherwise sections are more localized. *)


(* Can group a collection of theorems and definitions into a section. *)
(* Within that section, you can declare a kind of axiom, this axiom is a premise
   for everything else within that section that has some kind of dependency on the axiom. 
   One of the axioms within the section can refers to types and their propertioes.
   Can use the keyword variable or context. 
   They have slightly different behavior. Context seems preferable. *)

  (* 1. Type for Smt formulas and then smt queries.
     2. Law of excluded middle as an axiom.
     3. Smt engine's behavior as an axiom.
     4. Use 1 through 3 to prove a theorem about the equivalence checker itself. *)
