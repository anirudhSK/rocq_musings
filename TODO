Immediate next steps:
1. Generalize from pure function-based operations to operations that update header or state and leave the
   updated value in place after the function is completed.

Planned to dos:
1. Generalizing from single-packet semantics to stream semantics.
2. Unifying parsing and header processing into a single format.

Wishlist:
2. Semantics for the scheduler.
3. Looking at Xavier Leroy's summer school on compilers to see if there are any design patterns I am missing.
