Immediate next steps:
1. Equivalence checker
2. What is the story for initializing the concrete and symbolic state?
3. Finish semantics for MatchActionRule, Modules, etc.

Planned to dos:
1. Generalizing from single-packet semantics to stream semantics.
2. Unifying parsing and header processing into a single format.

Wishlist:
2. Semantics for the scheduler.
3. Looking at Xavier Leroy's summer school on compilers to see if there are any design patterns I am missing.
